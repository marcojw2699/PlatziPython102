# PlatziPython102 
*Project for Comprehensions, functions and errors handling class in Platzi Platform.*

Concepts from the class are applied to a medical dataset of patients with different variables and who might have or have not had health issues. This is a fork from https://github.com/aencardenas/Health and all commits will be done using Terminal, so we shall practice what we've learnt in Git & Github classes as well.

In detail, we will explore data through some graphics and finalize summarize it. In order to use this code, just run it and provide the gender (either male, either female) you wish to explore
